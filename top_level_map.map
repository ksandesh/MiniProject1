Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   113 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 113
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        186 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                      186 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             154
      Number using O5 output only:               2
      Number using O5 and O6:                   30
  Number of route-thrus:                         2
    Number using O6 output only:                 2

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    59 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          197
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            84 out of     197   42%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  11 out of     197    5%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         102 out of     197   51%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               3 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        14 out of     640    2%

    IOB Flip Flops:                              1

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1
